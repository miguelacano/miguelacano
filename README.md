# Miguel A. Cano
Senior Frontend Engineer | React + TypeScript | AI-First Builder  

I build scalable front-end systems and distributed applications with a strong focus on architecture, developer experience, and product quality. I care deeply about clean abstractions, thoughtful UI/UX, and systems that are observable, testable, and resilient.

---

## What I’m Focused On

- Building modern React / Next.js applications
- Designing modular architectures (micro-frontends, SDKs, distributed systems)
- Applying SOLID principles in frontend systems
- AI-augmented development workflows (LLM agents, repo indexing, test generation)
- Secure-by-default engineering (OWASP-aware design, sandboxing, validation)
- Improving release confidence through shift-left testing and automation

## Current Project: Appogia

**Appogia** is a music education platform focused on structured practice tracking, audio session capture, and intelligent feedback loops between teachers and students.

Key areas of exploration:

- Event logging and traceability across sessions
- Idempotent async processing for audio workflows
- Cloud storage architecture (object storage + relational data modeling)
- Observability patterns for distributed events
- AI-assisted analysis of performance metadata
- Security guardrails and compliance-aware design

This project serves as a sandbox for exploring production-grade architecture decisions in a greenfield environment.

## Engineering Philosophy

I approach engineering as systems design.

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Design APIs and components around clear contracts
- Optimize for readability and long-term maintainability
- Treat documentation as a first-class artifact
- Use AI tools intentionally to accelerate quality, not replace judgment

Strong engineering is not just about shipping features. It’s about building systems that scale in complexity without collapsing under it.

## AI-First Workflow

I actively integrate AI tools into development workflows:

- Repository indexing for architectural context
- Agent-assisted test generation
- Automated code review feedback loops
- Security scanning integration
- Structured planning with design documents and agent validation

AI is a force multiplier when paired with strong engineering fundamentals.
